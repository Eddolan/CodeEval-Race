# HR-CodeEval-Race

This repo contains the instructors for HR's CodeEval race social hack night. Please read them thoroughly and only begin coding when told to begin by the moderator.

## The challenge

The challenge at hand is to complete as many CodeEval problems as possible in 1 hour. Time will start when the moderator tells you to begin.

## What to do first

* Create an account on CodeEval.com
* Fork and clone this repo
* Read this ReadMe in depth
* Make sure you have node.js installed
* Wait till the moderator says begin

## If you already have a CodeEval account

You will want to create a new account for the challenge as you will not get credit for solutions completed before the challenge. You are welcome to redo the problems you have solved on a new account, but you should not look at the code form your prior solution.

## Installing Node.js

Follow the instructions for your OS [here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager). For most (on a Mac) it will be as easy as `brew install node`.

## During the challenge

* Find a problem you think can be quickly solved on CodeEval
* Copy the example directory to a new directory named after the problem you want to solve
* Copy the test examples shown on CodeEval to `test.txt`
* You can run the code in `solution.js` by navigating to that directory in a terminal window and running `node solution.js`
* After solving your problem locally, upload it to CodeEval
* After ensuring that you recieved full credit on CodeEval, repeat these steps for another problem until time is up

## How to get points

You will get 1 point for each CodeEval problem you fully solve in the 1 hour period. Points are only awareded for problems that CodeEval deems as 100% complete. Partial solutions (anything CodeEval grades less than 100) will not yield points. You must also have the up to date solution code in your fork of this repo that has been pushed to github.

The below images show a partially completed problem, which will not yield a point:

And a fully solved problem that will yield a point:

## What to do when time is up

In order to be eligible for winning the challenge you must do 3 things before time is up:

* Update the google spreadsheet with your CodeEval profile
* Push all of your solutions to GitHub
* Ping the moderator on Slack with the number of problems you got full credit for

## Other Rules

Violating any of the following rules will disqualify you from the competition

* Starting before time begins or continuing after the challenge ends.
* Using code found online for the solution. The rules rules apply as self-assesments where you are free to use the internet for guidance or issues, but cannot look up exact solutions for the problem at hand.
